# Trading Rules & Guidelines

## Core Philosophy
- **Never trade with money you can't afford to lose**
- Start small ($3-40 per trade for crypto, proportional for stocks)
- Document EVERY trade — wins AND losses
- Have a clear exit plan BEFORE entering

## Entry Rules

### 1. No FOMO Rule
- **NEVER buy a token/asset that's already pumped 200%+**
- Check 24h/7d price change before entering
- If already pumped >200%, mark as FOMO and skip

### 2. Dip Entry Only
- Only enter on **20% to 40% pullback from recent highs**
- Calculate pullback percentage: `(high - current) / high * 100`
- Must be between 20-40% pullback to qualify

### 3. Liquidity Check (Crypto Only)
- Always verify liquidity is locked
- Use DexScreener to check liquidity status
- Minimum liquidity threshold: $50k USD
