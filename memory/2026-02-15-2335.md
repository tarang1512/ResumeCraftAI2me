we were analyzing a picture
assistant: No memory of a recent image analysis yet. Checked your **HEARTBEAT.md**—there’s an *auto-vision handler* that spawns a `vision-local` sub-agent when you send images. Did the results not come through, or is this a new image you just sent?

If it’s new, go ahead and share it again—I’ll analyze it right away. If it’s pending, I’ll dig up the sub-agent’s output.

what skills can you get from github
assistant: Here’s what I can grab or build from GitHub right now—**no auth needed for public repos**:

---

### **1. Pre-Packaged Skills (Ready to Install)**
- **`gh` CLI Skill**: Full GitHub CLI automation (`gh issue`, `gh pr`, `gh run`, `gh api`).
  - *Repo*: Built into OpenClaw ([`github` skill](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/main/skills/github))
  - *Use case*: Manage issues, PRs, CI runs, or custom API queries for **RainbowBaby** or other projects.

- **`flutter-tools` Skill** *(Unbuilt, but easy to create)*:
  - Commands: `flutter analyze`, `flutter build`, `flutter test`, `flutter pub add`.
  - *Local path*: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/skills/flutter-tools/`
  - *Why?* Your RainbowBaby app could use auto-builds, dependency checks, or APK/IPA generation.

- **`aws-ec2` Skill** *(Unbuilt)*:
  - Commands: `aws ec2 start/stop/instances`, security group updates (for your Caddy/HTTPS issue).
  - *Use case*: Fix AWS port blocks without leaving Telegram.

---

### **2. Custom Skills (Build from GitHub Repos)**
Tell me a repo URL (or name/topic), and I’ll turn it into a **1-click OpenClaw skill** with:
- **Scripts** (Bash/Python)
- **Triggers** (cron, hooks, manual)
- **Docs** (cheat sheet in `SKILL.md`)

**Examples you could use**:
- **[Flutter CI/CD Templates](https://github.com/flutter/gallery)** → Auto-deploy RainbowBaby.
- **[Gujarati NLP Tools](https://github.com/gujarati-nlp)** → Expand your vocab script with sentiment analysis.
- **[Home Automation](https://github.com/home-assistant/core)** → Plug into Avani’s reminders (e.g., "baby room temperature alert").

---

### **3. Wildcard: Your Own Code**
If you’ve got a **private GitHub repo** (like RainbowBaby), I can:
1. Clone it (`git clone https://github.com/tarang1512/Rainbow-baby.git`).
2. Wrap it in a skill (e.g., `rainbowbaby` command to run tests, build, or sync HealthKit data).
3. Add cron jobs (e.g., "auto-commit at 6 PM daily").

---
### **How to Proceed**
- **Install a pre-built skill**: *"Add the `gh` skill for GitHub issues."*
- **Build a custom skill**: *"Turn `flutter/gallery` into a skill for auto-deploys."*
- **Automate your own repo**: *"Clone RainbowBaby, wrap it as a skill, and add a nightly build cron."*

spwan your best agent to work on rainbow baby app ,
assistant: Spawned `rainbowbaby-skill` agent with **DeepSeek-V3.2** to automate the RainbowBaby app. Here’s what it’s tackling:

1. **Repo Setup**: Cloning `tarang1512/Rainbow-baby`, resolving dependencies (`flutter pub get`).
2. **Build/Test**: Adding commands for APK/IPA builds, tests, and static analysis.
3. **HealthKit Check**: Verifying iOS entitlements and Flutter plugins.
4. **Skill Packaging**: Turning it all into a **1-command skill** with docs.

I’ll ping you when it’s ready (or if it hits snags like missing Flutter tools). Want to monitor progress or let it run in the background?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "conversation_label": "Tarang id:8593106797"
}
```

let me know the progress every 10 mins
assistant: Apologies for the tool hiccup. Let’s set this up manually:

---
### **Cron Job for 10-Minute Progress Updates**
I’ll create a **standalone cron job** to:
1. Check the `rainbowbaby-skill` agent’s status.
2. **DM you** with updates every 10 minutes.

**What it’ll report**:
- Current task (e.g., "Analyzing HealthKit permissions").
- Errors (if any).
- Completion percentage.

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a subagent task.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).
assistant: The `rainbowbaby-skill` agent just finished setting up the **RainbowBaby Flutter app automation**. Here’s what’s ready for you:

✅ **Flutter Setup**: Dependencies resolved, HealthKit plugins verified.
✅ **Build/Test Commands**: `flutter build apk/ios`, `flutter test`, and `flutter analyze` packaged as a 1-click skill.
📁 **Workspace**: Everything lives in `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/rainbow_baby_skill/` with a `SKILL.md` guide.

Want to test it or add more features (e.g., auto-deploy to TestFlight)?

add more features as all functions were unclickable
assistant: Spawned `rainbowbaby-ui-fix` agent with **DeepSeek-V3.2** to:

1. **Fix unclickable buttons/widgets** (missing `GestureDetector`/`InkWell`).
2. **Add features**:
   - HealthKit auto-sync (permissions + Android/iOS config).
   - Partner Mode (device-to-device sharing).
   - Weekly PDF reports (`pdf` package).
   - Dark Mode (theming).
3. **Update the skill** with new commands (`flutter fix-ui`, `flutter add-partner-mode`).

I’ll update you when it’s done. Want me to prioritize any feature?
