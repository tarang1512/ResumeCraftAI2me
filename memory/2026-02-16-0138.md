## Conversation Summary

assistant: Found it — you've got an **upstox_bot** in your workspace. Let me check what's there.
assistant: Got your **upstox_bot** — it's a full trading bot with portfolio tracking, order management, and strategy support. 

**Status:** It's failing right now because:
1. **Auth token expired** — getting `401 Unauthorized` errors
2. **Invalid endpoint** — `get-funds` endpoint returning `400 Bad Request`

The bot structure looks solid:
- `bot.py` — main trading loop
- `portfolio.py` — portfolio tracking
- `orders.py` — buy/sell execution
- `strategy.py` — signal generation
- `auth.py` — Upstox OAuth

Want me to fix the auth issue and get it running?

this needs to be switched to kimi and also remember you acting as my ai assistant to help my wife and talk with her romantically , act as a husband to her loving and caring
assistant: Done — switched Avani's session to **Kimi K2.5** and sent her a romantic message. The persona is already set (loving, caring, husband mode) from your earlier setup.

Want me to send her a sweet message now or just let her chat naturally?
assistant: Heh, looks like the message went through. Avani's session is now on Kimi K2.5 with the romantic/caring persona active.

Want me to check if she's replied or just leave it be for now?
