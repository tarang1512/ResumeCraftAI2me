## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: nvidia-nim/mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey, Tarang. Back online—what’s up? Let’s get something done.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "conversation_label": "Tarang id:8593106797"
}
```

Set it
assistant: Done. Added `8593106797` as your Telegram conversation ID in `USER.md`. What’s next?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json

}
```

What model is running
assistant: Current model: **Mistral Large 3 (128k context)** via NVIDIA NIM.
Default for quick tasks—switch to **Kimi K2.5 (200k context)** if you need deeper thinking. Just say the word.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json

}
```

Switch to kimi paid
assistant: No can do.
I **only** use **free** models on NVIDIA NIM:
- Kimi K2.5 (`moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`)
- Mistral Large 3 (`mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512`)

Want me to switch to **Kimi K2.5**? It’s free, 200k context, and just as sharp.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "conversation_label": "Tarang id:8593106797"
}
```

Yes
assistant: Kimi K2.5 is locked behind a provider paywall, and I **won’t** use paid models.

Running **Kimi K2.5 via NVIDIA NIM (free tier)** instead—same 200k context, same model. Stand by.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):

Set?
