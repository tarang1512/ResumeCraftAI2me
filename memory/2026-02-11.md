## Model Configuration

Successfully configured **NVIDIA-hosted Kimi K2.5** as the primary model:

- Provider: `nvidia-nim` with endpoint `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`
- Model ID: `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
- API key configured for NVIDIA NIM
- Fallbacks: `kimi-coding/k2p5` (Moonshot) → `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1` (NVIDIA free)

The onboard wizard kept resetting settings, so we used direct config patches. The correct model format for custom providers is `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`.

## User Profile Established
- **Name:** Tarang
- **Working style:** Listen once, execute; patient debugging; creative solutions; helpful/polite tone; no fluff
- **Wife:** Avani ("wifey")
  - Needs: shopping help, decision support
  - Personality: confused easily, loves shopping
  - Communication style: funny, romantic, caring, occasional roasting
  - Full access granted

## Gujarati Language Learning System
Created comprehensive vocabulary tracking system:
- **File:** `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/gujarati_vocab.md`
- **Current count:** 100+ words (greetings, basics, food, family, daily life, numbers, slang, emotions)
- **Cron job:** Daily 9 AM UTC automatic vocab update from web search
- **Learning source:** This WhatsApp chat history + daily web pulls
- **OCR:** Ready for Gujarati text extraction (PaddleOCR)
- **TTS:** Setup attempted (conda env issue — needs debugging)

## Agent Deployment
- Created second agent `wife-agent` in config for Avani
- Same model/config as main, separate memory isolation
- Awaiting gateway restart to activate

## Session Approach Defined
- Minimal context loading: only core identity files + daily memory
- No auto-load of full history (use memory_search on demand)
- Write session summaries at end

## Blockers
- TTS conda environment path issue — script running but conda not found
- Gateway restart disabled by default; needs manual CLI restart

## Gujarati Vocab Expansion (Evening/Night)
Learned 17+ slang terms from web search: `ghoghi`, `babuchak`, `ghamagham`, `dobi`, `vaidi`, `gadhedo`, `chaplo`, etc. — youth/hostel style Gujarati.

## Wife-agent Deployment
- **Decision:** Removed separate `wife-agent`, consolidated into main
- **Reason:** Easier management, same brain with persona switching
- **Current:** Tarang's number → debug mode; Avani's number → romantic/caring/funny
- **Status:** Active, Avani has been messaging

## Conda Installation
Installed Miniconda3 at `/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/bin/conda` — TTS setup resumed

## Anniversary Message
Sent romantic Gujarati shayari to Avani via WhatsApp (anniversary 2026-02-11)

## VisionClaw Installation
Cloned `sseanliu/VisionClaw` repo — iOS app for Meta Ray-Ban glasses + Gemini Live + OpenClaw
- Changed gateway bind from `loopback` to `lan` for iPhone connectivity
- Pending: iOS app config with Gemini API key

## Config Fix
Fixed invalid model ID: `openrouter/round-ratio/paon` → `openrouter/pony-alpha`

## Daily Gujarati Vocab Update (Automated)
**Theme:** Nature & Environment
**Added:** 32 words (hava, varsad, dariyo, chando, phool, etc.)
**Total vocab:** 130+ words

## USER_AVANI.md Created
Profile file for wifey with preferences:
- Nickname: baby / babe (never "chaato")
- WhatsApp: +18482479657
- Personality: confused easily, loves shopping
- Medicine reminder: 9:30 PM daily cron set

## Medicine Reminder Cron
Daily 9:30 PM India time (Asia/Kolkata) reminder for Avani — timezone updated since she's in New Delhi

## Caddy HTTPS Setup (In Progress)
**Domain:** ai2me.us (GoDaddy)
**AWS Public IP:** 13.221.145.84
**Goal:** Secure HTTPS dashboard access from anywhere
**Status:** Installing Caddy dependencies

## Dashboard Access Options
- Local: http://127.0.0.1:18789
- Network: http://172.31.94.103:18789 (internal)
- Direct: http://13.221.145.84:18789 (works now)
- HTTPS: Caddy removed, issues with AWS security groups blocking SSL challenges

## RainbowBaby App Build Progress
**GitHub Setup Attempted:** Username `tarang1512`, token provided
**Status:** Repo creation blocked by token permissions (needs Classic PAT with `repo` scope)
**App Code:** Currently only scaffold (2 Dart files) — full build pending
**Decision:** Manual GitHub repo creation preferred over token regeneration

## Browser Relay / Extension
**Issue:** OpenClaw Chrome extension origin blocked — configuration mismatch between `loopback` and `lan` modes
**Status:** Wontfix for now, using direct IP access instead

## Session Initialization Rules (User-defined)
**Effective:** 2026-02-11

On every session start:
1. **Load ONLY:** SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (if exists)
2. **DO NOT auto-load:** MEMORY.md, session history, prior messages, previous tool outputs
3. **When user asks about prior context:** Use memory_search() on demand → memory_get() for relevant snippets only
4. **Update memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md at session end with:** What worked on, decisions made, leads generated, blockers, next steps
