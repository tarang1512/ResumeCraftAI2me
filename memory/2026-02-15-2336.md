## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: nvidia-nim/mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512

A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: The SSH tunnel isn’t working because **OpenClaw’s gateway runs on `127.0.0.1:18789` by default**, but your local port `8080` isn’t connecting. Let’s debug:

### **Quick Fixes**
1. **Check if the gateway is running** on the AWS instance:
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway status
   ```
   *(Run this in a terminal on the AWS machine or use `exec` here.)*

2. **Verify the tunnel command**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "/Users/tarang/Downloads/patelbotaws.pem" -L 8080:localhost:18789 ubuntu@13.221.145.84 -N -v
   ```
   - `-v` = verbose (shows where it fails).
   - `-N` = no remote command (just forward ports).

3. **AWS Security Groups**:
   - Confirm **inbound port 22 (SSH)** is open for your IP.
   - Check **outbound ports** aren’t blocked (e.g., corporate networks often block `8080`).

### **If the Gateway is Dead**
- **Restart it**:
  ```bash
  openclaw gateway restart
  ```
  *(Run via `exec` or on the AWS machine directly.)*

---

### **Fallback: Use the Public IP**
If the tunnel fails, try accessing the gateway directly via its **public IP** (if HTTPS is set up):
```
http://13.221.145.84:18789
```
*(Caddy may block this—let’s fix it if it does.)*

---
**Next Step**: Run `openclaw gateway status` on the AWS machine and paste the output. Or I can spawn a debug agent to check.
assistant: Hey. What's up? Need something done, or just here to chat?
