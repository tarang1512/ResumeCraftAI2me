find new skills on clawhub
assistant: I don't have direct access to browse ClawHub or search for new skills. I can only see what's already installed in your workspace.

**Options to find new skills:**

1. **You browse ClawHub** — https://clawhub.com — and tell me which skills you want
2. **I can check the OpenClaw docs** — for skill installation instructions
3. **GitHub search** — I can search GitHub for `openclaw skills` or related repos

Want me to search GitHub for available OpenClaw skills? Or you can browse ClawHub and tell me what to install.

openclaw skills or related repos Want me to search GitHub for available OpenClaw skills
assistant: Brave Search API key missing. Let me use Perplexity instead:
assistant: I don't have a direct `perplexity-search` tool available — it's a skill that provides instructions, not a callable tool. 

Let me check what tools I actually have and try a different approach:
assistant: Perplexity API key exists. Let me search for OpenClaw skills using curl:
assistant: Found some OpenClaw skill resources! Here's what's available:

## Official OpenClaw Resources

~/.openclaw/cli/free-search "Python tutorials" free-search "AI news" | jq '.results[0].title' # From Python python3 ~/.openclaw/tools/free_web_search.py "search query"
assistant: I don't have access to those tools. Let me check if they exist:
assistant: Those tools don't exist in your setup. The commands you mentioned aren't available.

**What I have for search:**
- **Perplexity API** ✅ — Working (API key configured)
- **Brave Search** — Needs API key configured
- **Web fetch** — For specific URLs

Want me to search for something using Perplexity? Or do you want to set up Brave Search?

brew install gemini-cli
assistant: I can't run `brew install` — I'm in a Linux environment (AWS EC2), not macOS. Brew doesn't work here.

**Options to install gemini-cli:**

1. **Use pip/npm instead** — If gemini-cli has a Python/Node package
2. **Download binary directly** — From GitHub releases
3. **You install it on your local machine** — If you want it locally

Want me to check if there's a Linux-compatible way to install it? Or what do you want to use gemini-cli for — maybe I can do it directly with the Gemini API?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "conversation_label": "Tarang id:8593106797"
}
```

yes
assistant: I can use the Gemini API directly. Let me check if you have a Gemini API key configured:
assistant: Gemini API key exists! What do you want to do with Gemini?

**Options:**
- **Chat/ask questions** — Use Gemini models for responses
- **Generate content** — Text, code, analysis
- **Image understanding** — Gemini has vision capabilities
- **Compare with Kimi** — See how Gemini vs Kimi responds

What task do you want Gemini for?
