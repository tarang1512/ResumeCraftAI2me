## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ **MiniMax M2.1 exists** in the API — I can see it in the list: `minimaxai/minimax-m2.1`

The model is there, but requests are timing out. This is likely a **cold start issue** — MiniMax M2.1 might need to spin up on first request.

**Summary:**

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Added to OpenClaw config | ✅ Done |
| Created test script | ✅ Done |
| API test | ⚠️ Timeout (cold start?) |

**Model is available** — you can use it now:
```
/model nvidia-nim/minimaxai/minimax-m2.1
```

Or via alias (after gateway restart):
```
/model MiniMax
```

Want me to restart the gateway to apply the config changes?

```json

  "conversation_label": "+18482025368"
}
```

you back
assistant: I'm back. The gateway restart command isn't available via the tool. You'll need to restart it manually:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Or if that doesn't work:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart openclaw
```

Once it's back up, the MiniMax model will be available. If the gateway doesn't start properly, just let me know and I'll help you switch back to Kimi.

```openclaw gateway restart```
assistant: I can't run that command directly — the gateway restart tool is disabled in my config. You need to run it yourself in your terminal:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Or if you have systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart openclaw
```

Once you restart it, the MiniMax model will be available. Let me know when it's back up or if you hit any issues.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "conversation_label": "+18482025368"
}
```

restarted
assistant: Great! Gateway is back up. MiniMax M2.1 should now be available.

**To use it:**
```
/model nvidia-nim/minimaxai/minimax-m2.1
```
or
```
/model MiniMax
```

**To switch back to Kimi if needed:**
```
/model Kimi
```
or
```
/model moonshot/kimi-k2.5
```

Want me to test the MiniMax model now, or switch you to it?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json

assistant: ✅ **MiniMax M2.1 is active!**

I'm now running on MiniMax M2.1 via NVIDIA NIM. The model is working — you can see it in the status above.

Test me out. Ask me something.
