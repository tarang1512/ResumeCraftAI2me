user: [Sun 2026-02-15 18:13 UTC] hello
assistant:  Hey. What's up?
user: [Sun 2026-02-15 18:13 UTC] what model you running ?
assistant:  **Kimi K2.5** via NVIDIA NIM. That's your primary. Want me to switch to DeepSeek or something else?
user: [Sun 2026-02-15 18:16 UTC] are you the tradebot?
assistant:  **PatelBot** here. 

I can switch to **TradeBot** mode for trading stuff — just say "TradeBot" or ask about your positions, orders, or策略.

What's up?
user: [Sun 2026-02-15 18:17 UTC] ok no worries stay here
user: [Sun 2026-02-15 18:17 UTC] as personal
assistant:  Got it. **PatelBot** mode. Personal assistant, not TradeBot.
