What model you on?
user: System: [2026-02-19 18:10:39 EST] ⚠️ Post-Compaction Audit: The following required startup files were not read after context reset:
  - WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
  - memory\/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md

Please read them now using the Read tool before continuing. This ensures your operating protocols are restored after memory compaction.

Switch models to minimax
assistant: Got it — both files don't exist, so nothing to restore.

Model's already on **minimax** (nvidia-nim/minimaxai/minimax-m2.1) per the runtime. We're good to go.

assistant: The "missing files" warning is a false alarm — those files just don't exist in your workspace, so nothing to restore. Ignore it.
