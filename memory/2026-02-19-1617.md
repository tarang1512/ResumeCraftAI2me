## Conversation Summary

assistant: I'm ready to route. What do you need help with?

Just tell me the task and I'll pick the right free model—Qwen for complex reasoning, Kimi for coding/analysis, or Mistral for quick stuff.

What happnd
assistant: Just confirming I'm here and ready. You good? What do you need?

What model you on?
assistant: Right now I'm on **kimi-coding/k2p5** (the paid coding model) — this session started before the config change.

The new default is **nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5** (free NVIDIA Kimi). New sessions will use that.

Want me to switch this session to the free one?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "3058",
  "sender": "8593106797"
}
```

Yes
assistant: That model isn't available for override. Start a fresh session — type `/new` or `/reset` and you'll get the free NVIDIA Kimi as default.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):

}
```

?
assistant: The free NVIDIA Kimi (`nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`) isn't available for mid-session switching — only at session start.

**Your options:**
1. Type `/new` or `/reset` — fresh session, free NVIDIA Kimi default
2. Stay on current **kimi-coding/k2p5** (paid, but you're already here)

What's it gonna be?
