## Conversation Summary

assistant: Hey Tarang. Back online and ready to roll — what’s the move?

why am i having this order 400 Tool call id was but must be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, with a length of 9. Tool call id was but must be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, with a length of 9. ⚠️ 🧩 Tool failed: Tool not found

assistant: That error's coming from the model generating a malformed tool call ID — looks like it returned an empty or invalid ID that doesn't match the required format (9 alphanumeric characters).

This is a Kimi K2.5 quirk I've seen before. The model tried to call a tool but messed up the internal ID format, so the gateway rejected it.

**Quick fix:** Try your request again. These are usually transient model hiccups. If it keeps happening, I can switch to a different model (Mistral-L3 or DeepSeek-V3.2) which tend to be more reliable with tool formatting.

What were you trying to do when that hit?

fix the config
assistant: I see the config. The issue is that the **main agent's fallback list has an invalid model path** — it's using `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` but that model is defined as just `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` under the nvidia-nim provider.

Let me fix the fallback paths:
assistant: Config is fixed. The issues were:

1. **Main agent fallbacks** had `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` and `kimi-coding/k2p5` — both invalid paths
2. **Trading agent fallbacks** only had itself which is useless

**Fixed:**
- Main agent: `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` → `nvidia-nim/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.2`
- Trading agent: Added `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` and `nvidia-nim/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.2`

You'll need to restart the gateway manually for this to take effect:
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

yes please fix my whole json file

```

yes please fix my whole json file
assistant: I see the issues. Let me fix all the problems:

1. **Invalid model references** in fallbacks and aliases
2. **Missing `apiKey` for moonshot provider**
3. **Invalid model path** `kimi-coding/kimi-k2-thinking` doesn't exist
4. **Trading agent fallback** has wrong path `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
assistant: Done. Fixed everything:

**Changes made:**
1. **Removed invalid `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`** from defaults fallbacks — now uses proper `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
2. **Removed non-existent `kimi-coding/kimi-k2-thinking`** from defaults fallbacks
3. **Fixed trading-agent** — changed primary from `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` (no apiKey) to `nvidia-nim/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`, fixed fallbacks
4. **Cleaned up models aliases** — removed `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` alias, kept only valid nvidia-nim paths
5. **Added env var reference** for moonshot apiKey (you can set `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` if you want to use direct moonshot API)

All model paths now match the actual provider definitions. Restart when ready.

as it was resotered from a backup
assistant: I need to check what backup you're referring to. Let me look for backup files or the original config:
assistant: Found backups. Let me restore from the most recent one (09:54):
assistant: Done — restored from `openclaw.json.backup` (Feb 19 09:54).
