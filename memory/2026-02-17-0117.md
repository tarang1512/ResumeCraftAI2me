user: [Mon 2026-02-16 20:57 UTC] A cron job "JIOFIN Order Fill Alert" just completed successfully.

Findings:
The `check_jiofin_order.py` script failed due to an "Invalid Endpoint" error when calling the Upstox API. This suggests one of the following issues:

1. **Incorrect API Endpoint**: The script may be using an outdated or incorrect URL for fetching order details.
2. **API Key or Authentication Issue**: The API key or authentication token might be invalid or expired.
3. **Order ID Format Issue**: The order ID might not be formatted correctly for the API request.

---
### Next Steps
1. **Check the Script**: Review the script at `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/upstox_bot/check_jiofin_order.py` to verify the API endpoint and authentication logic.
2. **Update API Endpoint**: Ensure the script is using the correct Upstox API endpoint for order details (e.g., `https://api.upstox.com/v2/order/history` or similar).
3. **Verify API Key**: Confirm the API key or token is valid and has the required permissions.
4. **Test Manually**: Run a manual test with `curl` or Postman to debug the API request.

---
### Action Required
**No WhatsApp alert will be sent** due to the failure. I recommend reviewing the script and API configuration before the next run.

Stats: runtime 24s • tokens 15.7k (in 45.3k / out 340) • est $0.0000 • sessionKey agent:main:cron:0566e7ba-bad4-44b3-a07a-1242b73d2d8d:run:d6074cc5-658e-4ad1-a00f-6575adc13b56 • sessionId d6074cc5-658e-4ad1-a00f-6575adc13b56 • transcript /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/d6074cc5-658e-4ad1-a00f-6575adc13b56.jsonl

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a cron job.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).

user: [Mon 2026-02-16 21:02 UTC] A cron job "JIOFIN Order Fill Alert" just completed successfully.

Findings:
The script failed due to an **invalid API endpoint** (`https://api.upstox.com/v2/order/orders`). The Upstox API likely requires a different endpoint to fetch order details.

### Next Steps
1. **Verify the correct API endpoint** for fetching order details in the [Upstox API documentation](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation).
2. **Update the script** to use the correct endpoint (e.g., `/v2/order/history` or `/v2/order/detail`).
3. **Test locally** before retrying.

No alert was sent since the order status is unconfirmed.

*Summary for delivery:*
**No action taken.** Script failed due to an invalid API endpoint (`400 Bad Request`). Requires endpoint correction and retesting.

user: [Mon 2026-02-16 21:07 UTC] A cron job "JIOFIN Order Fill Alert" just completed successfully.

Findings:
The script failed due to an **invalid API endpoint** (`UDAPI100012: Invalid Endpoint`). This typically means the URL or order ID format is incorrect for the Upstox API.

### Next Steps
1. **Verify the API endpoint**: The script is using `https://api.upstox.com/v2/order/orders`, but this may not be the correct path for fetching a specific order. The correct endpoint might require the order ID as part of the path (e.g., `https://api.upstox.com/v2/order/detail` or similar).
2. **Check the script**: Review `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/upstox_bot/check_jiofin_order.py` to confirm the API endpoint and request format.
3. **Manual check**: If the script cannot be fixed immediately, manually verify the order status in the Upstox app or website and notify Tarang if the order has filled.

### Action
I will **not** send the WhatsApp alert yet, as the order status is unconfirmed. Will investigate the script and retry.
